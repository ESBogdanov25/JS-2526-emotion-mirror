# JS-2526-emotion-mirror
A real-time webcam mirror that applies visual effects based on user input. Users can type a mood and see the webcam feed react with corresponding filters like glitch, pixelation, RGB split, and color tints. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS filters, this project demonstrates creative DOM manipulation and webcam integration.
